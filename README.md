# TLInterview 

Hello,

Thank you for this learning opportunity and interview experience. By attempting this project, I learned a great deal about WARC and the Common Crawl archives. I have never done a project on such a massive scale and so this was unique to me. My main idea on how to approach this was to search for keywords in the HTML pages and then print out the url's which matched. I did succeed in writing something to this extent in covid.py, but it seems to be much to slow. 

I spent a lot of my time trying to track down the WET and WAT file formats because I believed they would give me a faster run time since they are supposed to be only text/HTML. However, what I mostly succeeded in doing was causing myself a lot of frustration.

Again, thank you for this opportunity. 

Best,
Isadora
